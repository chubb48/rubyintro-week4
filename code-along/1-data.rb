# Combine strings and variables

# String manipulation

# # # put the number 2 on the screen

# puts 2 + 5

# # put our fav food on screen
# puts "tacos"

# #true and false 
# puts true
# puts false

# # nothing
# puts nil

# # store the number 5 in memory
# x = 5 
# #store the numer 2 in memory
# y = 2
# # multiply the 2 numbers and show them on screen
# puts x * y

# # store my fav food in memory
